### New

### Improve

### Fix

- Fixed a crash when opening a manga's cover preview on a source that serves covers in AVIF, JXL or HEIF (Atsumaru, for one). The preview asked the new image decoder for its raw pixels while another decoder also claimed those formats and won the race, so the app tried to treat an ordinary bitmap as raw pixel data and died on the main thread. The request now reaches the decoder it asked for, and a cover that arrives in an unexpected form leaves the preview empty instead of taking the app down with it.
- Fix the v1.25.0 database migration failing for users updating from v1.24.5, which left the app unable to open its library on launch: a leftover sync trigger referenced the old tables mid-rework, and a duplicate-merge step could null out required fields. The emergency build migrates cleanly; affected libraries keep their entries, read state and categories.
